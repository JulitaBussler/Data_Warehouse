This is the main SCD2 logic implemented using the MERGE statement. 
It merges the data from the StoreView3 view into the Dim_Store table. Here's a breakdown of the different cases handled:

WHEN Not Matched: 
If a row from StoreView3 does not have a matching BK_StoreID in Dim_Store, it means it's a new record. 
In this case, a new row is inserted into Dim_Store with the values from StoreView3 and the entry date as the start date.

WHEN Matched AND (ST.Size <> TT.Size) AND TT.Activeness = 'active':
If a row from StoreView3 has a matching BK_StoreID in Dim_Store but the Size has changed and the existing row in Dim_Store is still active,
it means an update is needed. The existing row in Dim_Store is marked as 'inactive' with the finish date set to the entry date.

WHEN Not Matched BY Source AND TT.BK_StoreID != -1:
If a row exists in Dim_Store that doesn't have a matching BusinessID in StoreView3 and the BK_StoreID is not -1,
it means the record doesn't exist in the source anymore. In this case, the row in Dim_Store is marked as 'inactive' with the finish date set to the entry date.
