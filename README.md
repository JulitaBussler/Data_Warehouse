## Feasibility Queries

Feasibility queries based on the multidimensional model for evaluating marketing campaigns include:

1. Compare TrafficRatio over the years.
2. Compare SalesRatio over the years.
3. Compare the average sales ratio and traffic ratio from a certain month and year to the SMETotal.
4. Examine the relationship between average monthly traffic volume and the size of the stores.
5. Determine which social media platform generates the biggest sales ratio and traffic ratio at a specific year.
6. Identify the company providing marketing campaigns that create the biggest traffic ratio at a specific year.
7. Explore the relationship between the cost of marketing campaigns and the SalesRatio.

## Evaluation of Marketing Campaigns

### Business Process Description

The evaluation process of marketing campaigns involves extracting data about every post and video included in a specific campaign. This data includes metrics such as likes, comments, views, and the number of new followers gained. The evaluation takes place after the campaign finishes, where Beauty Haven identifies the most successful campaign based on the accumulated likes, views, and comments.

### Typical Questions

Typical questions in evaluating marketing campaigns include:

1. How many likes, comments, views, and new followers were generated by a campaign after a specific duration?
2. On which platform (TikTok or Instagram) did a campaign generate the highest number of views?
3. How does sales change before and after the start of a campaign?
4. Is store traffic affected by a specific marketing campaign?

### Data Sources

Data sources for the evaluation of marketing campaigns include:

- Beauty Days database: Contains information about daily store activities, sales, traffic, localisation, and basic store data.
- Excel file: Contains data about companies conducting marketing campaigns, including company IDs and names.
